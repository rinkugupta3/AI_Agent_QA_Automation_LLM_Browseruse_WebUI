Functional Scenarios: Test the core login and logout functionalities.
Positive Scenarios: Verify successful login and logout with valid credentials.
Negative Scenarios: Test login failures with invalid credentials, incorrect formats, etc.
Edge Cases: Include tests for extreme inputs (e.g., very long usernames, special characters).
Cross-Browser Testing: Ensure compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers.
Security Testing: Cover SQL injection and brute force attack vulnerabilities.
Performance Testing: Measure response times and handle concurrent user scenarios.
Accessibility Testing:

Perceivable: Text alternatives, adaptable content, distinguishable elements.
Operable: Keyboard accessibility, time limits, seizure prevention, navigation.
Understandable: Readable text, input assistance.
Robust: Compatibility with assistive technologies.

Generate a test case file (e.g., CSV, XLSX, or a structured text file) with the following columns:
Description: A clear description of the test case.
Scenario: The specific scenario being tested (e.g., "Valid Login," "Invalid Password").
Expected Result: The anticipated outcome of the test.
